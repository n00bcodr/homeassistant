"""In-process WebSocket command surface for the ha_mcp_tools component.

This module registers versioned ``ha_mcp_tools/*`` WebSocket commands that the
ha-mcp server calls in-process (same HA core, no REST/WS round-trips) behind a
capability gate. It registers twenty-two commands (twenty-two capabilities — the
``search_visibility`` capability is a flag on the existing ``search`` command,
and ``info`` itself carries no capability entry):

* ``ha_mcp_tools/info`` — the handshake: ``schema_version`` + ``capabilities[]``
  + ``component_version`` + advisory ``limits`` + the instance ``timezone``
  (an additive field consumers detect by presence — no capability entry). One
  cached probe tells the server which commands are live (capability
  negotiation, NOT a version floor).
* ``ha_mcp_tools/search`` — a unified in-process search over live registries and
  states, joined and scored, mirroring today's ``ha_search`` response envelope.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/overview`` — the raw in-process reads the server's
  ``get_system_overview`` + ``ha_get_overview`` wrapper consume (states,
  services, entity/device/area registries, ``hass.config``, persistent
  notifications, repairs issues) in one call, so the server builds its existing
  overview envelope with no extra HA round-trips.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/helpers_list`` — collection helpers (live state-attribute
  bodies) AND flow helpers (``ConfigEntry.options``/``title``/``entry_id`` —
  never ``entry.data``), each with the CURRENT entity_id + display name from the
  registry (renamed helpers show current values — issue #1794), closing the
  documented "flow helpers cannot be listed" gap with no OptionsFlow dance. The
  response's ``covered_types`` names which helper_type values were authoritatively
  enumerated, so the server falls back to its legacy ``<type>/list`` path for an
  uncovered type (e.g. ``tag``, which has no state entity) instead of trusting an
  empty result.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/states`` — a bulk state read: ``State.as_dict()`` for each
  requested entity_id (a pure ``hass.states.get`` in-memory read) plus the list
  of ids with no state, so the server's ``ha_get_state`` serves a 100-entity
  bulk call from one in-process frame instead of up to 100 REST GETs. The body
  is byte-identical to the REST ``/api/states/<id>`` serialization by
  construction; the server maps found/missing onto its per-id error contract.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/blueprint_get`` — the full body of one installed blueprint
  (``{metadata, config}``), which core's ``blueprint/list`` never returns (it
  serves only ``{metadata}``). The path is jailed under
  ``<config>/blueprints/<domain>/`` (symlink-safe containment, mirroring the
  file-tool jail) and the file read + parse run off the event loop in the async
  prep. ``!input`` markers are preserved; every other custom tag (``!secret`` /
  ``!include`` / …) is neutralized to ``None`` at load time, so no resolved
  secret plaintext can ever reach the body.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/device_get`` — one device registry entry by id
  (``{device: <DeviceEntry.dict_repr> | None}``), so a single-device lookup no
  longer pulls the entire device registry. The body is core's
  ``DeviceEntry.dict_repr`` returned VERBATIM — byte-identical to one element of
  ``config/device_registry/list`` (which sends ``json_bytes(entry.dict_repr)``)
  by construction, since this command's ``connection.send_result`` runs the same
  JSON encoder over the same dict. Consumers keep their own transforms over the
  raw shape; ``device`` is ``None`` when no such device exists. With
  ``include_entities`` set, a sibling ``entities`` key carries the device's
  entity-registry rows (``RegistryEntry.as_partial_dict``, the
  ``config/entity_registry/list`` shape, disabled entities included) so listing a
  device's entities no longer pulls the whole entity registry either — the raw
  DeviceEntry stays untouched; the join is a sibling.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/device_list`` — every device registry entry as that same raw
  ``DeviceEntry.dict_repr`` shape (``{devices: [...]}``): the in-process
  equivalent of ``config/device_registry/list`` served through the component
  seam, so ``ha_get_device`` list mode need not mix a legacy WS read with the
  component path.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/entity_enrich`` — the area/floor/labels/aliases join for a set
  of entity_ids (``{entities: {id: {area, floor, labels, aliases}}}``), computed
  by the SAME ``_entity_record``/``_RegistryView`` registry join the search path
  uses (device-inherited area/labels included). Lets ``ha_get_entity`` add the
  resolved-name enrichment fields the raw registry entry lacks (it carries
  ``area_id`` / label *ids*, not resolved names) without the caller fanning out
  its own area/floor/label registry reads. Registry-only entities (no state) are
  enriched too — the join keys off the registry, not the state machine.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/exposure`` — voice-assistant exposure with names/areas attached.
  List mode mirrors core's ``ws_list_exposed_entities`` (``{exposed_entities:
  {id: {assistant: True}}}`` — byte-identical to ``homeassistant/expose_entity/
  list``); single-entity mode reads core's module-level
  ``async_get_entity_settings``. Both add a sibling ``entity_info`` map enriching
  each id through the same registry join (friendly_name/domain/area/floor/labels),
  so the server no longer needs a second search + manual correlation to name an
  exposed entity. Three parity guardrails hold: only ``should_expose``-true
  assistants are reported (the raw helper is not pre-filtered like the legacy
  shape); core's ``HomeAssistantError("Unknown entity")`` on a junk id degrades to
  the not-exposed default (the legacy path never raises on junk); and a missing
  ``hass.states.get(id)`` omits the live-state fields (friendly_name/state) rather
  than crashing.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/dashboards`` — Lovelace dashboards read in-process, three modes.
  ``list`` mirrors the ``lovelace/dashboards/list`` row shape (id/url_path/title/
  icon/show_in_sidebar/require_admin) with an additive per-row ``mode`` so the
  server can exclude YAML dashboards; ``get`` returns one dashboard's config body
  (``await store.async_load`` in the async prep) with a structured
  ``yaml_excluded`` status for YAML-mode dashboards (the server falls back to
  legacy for those — a YAML body may carry resolved ``!secret`` plaintext);
  ``search`` walks every STORAGE dashboard's views/cards/sections (plus view-level
  badges and sections-view header cards) for a query substring (capped at 200 with a
  ``truncated`` flag). YAML-dashboard bodies are never emitted — storage-only. All
  Store loads run in :func:`_dashboards_prep`.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/services_list`` — the REST ``/api/services`` service catalog
  (``async_get_all_descriptions``) joined with the ``services`` backend
  translations (``async_get_translations``), both loaded in the async prep.
  Filtered by ``domain`` (exact) only; the server re-runs its exact query filter +
  pagination over the payload. No ``query`` coarse-filter (a per-service superset of
  the server's concatenation-based filter cannot be built cheaply, and no consumer
  forwards ``query``).
* ``ha_mcp_tools/reference_data`` — the service index + entity-id universe the
  config-reference validator consumes: ``{services: [{domain, services:{name:{}}}],
  entity_ids: [...]}``. The ``services`` shape is the REST ``/api/services`` list
  ``build_service_index`` reads (bodies are empty dicts — the index only reads
  keys); ``entity_ids`` is every ``hass.states.async_all()`` id. Pure, no prep.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/search`` (``search_visibility`` capability) — the search command
  additionally accepts a raw ``visibility`` config dict; when present it excludes
  the server's opt-in hidden entities before counts/pagination (the pure
  :func:`_visibility_hidden_set` mirrors the server's ``hidden_entity_ids``, with
  the Assist dimension delegated to core's ``async_should_expose``), so
  ``ha_search`` can route through the component even with an active filter. A
  degraded dimension (unknown ``exclude_category`` / empty-registry allowlist /
  unavailable Assist) fails open, and :func:`_visibility_warnings` returns the
  resolver-parity ``visibility_warnings`` the response carries so the filtering is
  not silently incomplete.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/server_entry`` — the component locates its OWN server config
  entry (``entry.data[CONF_ENTRY_TYPE] == server``, the one marker key it reads
  from ``entry.data``) and returns ``{entry_id, channel, pip_spec}`` (channel /
  pip_spec from ``entry.options``), so ``ha_dev_manage_server`` need not probe
  every ``ha_mcp_tools``-domain entry's options-flow schema from the outside.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/server_entry_update`` — the WRITE counterpart of ``server_entry``:
  applies a ``channel`` / ``pip_spec`` delta to the server entry via
  ``hass.config_entries.async_update_entry`` DIRECTLY (what core's finish-flow
  does), collapsing ``ha_dev_manage_server(update_source)``'s options-flow start +
  submit round-trip in embedded mode. The delta is MERGED against the LIVE
  ``entry.options`` AT APPLY time (every existing key preserved — a concurrent
  change to another key during the flush window is not clobbered — no blanking of
  the URL/secret overrides), so no preserved-key resend is needed. The
  ``async_update_entry`` fires the entry's own update listener → reload → the
  hardened reinstall; because that reload tears down the very server thread
  answering this frame, the call is NOT made inline — it is scheduled on a
  HASS-level background task (:func:`hass.async_create_background_task`, NOT the
  entry's, so the reload can't cancel it) after :data:`SERVER_ENTRY_UPDATE_FLUSH_DELAY_S`,
  and the prep returns ``{scheduled: True, ...}`` immediately so the WS response
  flushes first. A no-op (merged options equal the current ones) returns
  ``{scheduled: False, unchanged: True, ...}`` without scheduling; no server entry
  raises ``HomeAssistantError`` (→ the server's command-error fallback to its legacy
  options-flow path). All awaiting-adjacent work (the deferred apply) lives in
  :func:`_server_entry_update_prep`; :func:`_do_server_entry_update` is a pure formatter.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/call_service`` — the FIRST write capability. Fires exactly one
  ``hass.services.async_call`` in-process and returns the REAL pre→post state
  transition for the target ``entity_ids`` — event-confirmed via an
  ``EVENT_STATE_CHANGED`` listener registered BEFORE the dispatch (closing the
  fast-entity race). The server's optional ``expected_state`` hint governs only WHEN
  the confirming state is settled — the waiter confirms on reaching it (skipping a
  multi-phase service's intermediate states and attribute-only noise) and immediate-
  matches an idempotent no-op — but the RETURNED transition is always the real
  observed one, never the hint. All awaiting work (the dispatch, the immediate-match,
  the bounded confirmation wait) runs in :func:`_call_service_prep`;
  :func:`_do_call_service` is a pure formatter. An AUTHORITATIVE component-side
  domain block refuses ``domain == "ha_mcp_tools"`` (case/whitespace-normalized)
  BEFORE any ``has_service``/dispatch, independent of (and in addition to) the
  server-side guard — so this second write path can NEVER be turned into an
  in-process invoker of the admin-gated ``ha_mcp_tools.*`` services
  (``get_caller_token`` → arbitrary config-dir file/YAML writes). A confirmation
  timeout is reported as ``partial`` (``success`` still holds); a failure BEFORE
  the dispatch raises, a failure AFTER it does not (the call already landed).
* ``ha_mcp_tools/bulk_call_service`` — the BATCH write capability (D5a). One frame
  runs the D1 ``ha_mcp_tools`` domain block for EVERY operation FIRST, before any
  dispatch or listener: a batch is fail-closed — one refused op raises the whole
  frame and NOTHING dispatches, so no partial batch can smuggle a
  ``ha_mcp_tools.*`` (or unknown-service) op past the guard. It then registers ALL
  confirmation listeners in one synchronous pass BEFORE any dispatch
  (register-before-fire is trivially correct for the batch), fires the operations
  (``parallel`` by default, or sequentially), and waits on ONE shared deadline for
  every op's transition. A per-op ``async_call`` failure under ``parallel`` is
  captured on that op's result (``error`` + ``dispatched: false``) WITHOUT aborting
  the others; a post-dispatch confirmation timeout is ``partial``, never a failure.
  All awaiting work lives in :func:`_bulk_call_service_prep`;
  :func:`_do_bulk_call_service` is a pure formatter that reuses the single
  ``call_service`` guard / transition / diff helpers.

* ``ha_mcp_tools/config_entries`` — config entries as the ``config_entries/get``
  WS shape (``created_at`` / ``modified_at`` / ``entry_id`` / ``domain`` /
  ``title`` / ``state`` / ``source`` / ``supports_*`` / ``supported_subentry_types``
  / ``pref_disable_*`` / ``disabled_by`` / ``reason`` / ``options`` /
  ``subentries`` — the full ``as_json_fragment`` field set), filtered by ``domain``
  or fetched by
  ``entry_id``. ``state`` is serialized as ``ConfigEntryState.value`` (mirroring
  core's ``as_json_fragment``). ``entry.data`` (integration credentials) is
  NEVER read; ``options`` is passed through a resolved-``!secret`` scrub (an
  options leaf equal to a ``secrets.yaml`` value becomes ``"**redacted**"``,
  loaded off the loop by :func:`_config_entries_prep`) — data minimization
  parity with the flow-helper indexing.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/registry_lookup`` — entity-registry rows
  (``RegistryEntry.as_partial_dict``, the ``config/entity_registry/list`` shape,
  disabled entities included) for either a set of ``entity_ids`` (missing ids in
  a sibling ``missing`` list) or ALL entities bound to a ``config_entry_id``. The
  config-entry scan returns EVERY match — it does not reuse the single-valued
  ``_entities_by_config_entry`` index, so a multi-entity flow helper
  (utility_meter + its tariffs) does not silently lose its sub-entities. Exactly
  one of the two is required; a request with NEITHER raises
  ``HomeAssistantError`` rather than silently returning an empty result.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/system_snapshot`` — one consistent synchronous pass over the
  live objects the health path reads: ``config_entries`` (identity fields only —
  no options/subentries), ``issues`` (the ``_overview_repairs`` slice),
  ``entities`` (the ``registry_lookup`` row shape), ``states``
  (``State.as_dict()``). ``include_*`` flags gate each section. Reading them in a
  single frame kills the 3x ``config_entries/get`` TOCTOU the server had.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/entity_lookup`` — registry entries whose ``unique_id`` matches
  (optionally narrowed by ``domain`` / ``platform``), returned as
  ``{matches: [{entity_id, unique_id, platform, domain, config_entry_id,
  categories, disabled_by, hidden_by}]}``. Multiple matches across platforms are
  all returned; the server picks. The in-process read is authoritative
  immediately (no registry-write settle retry).
* ``ha_mcp_tools/backup_prep`` — the backup identity the server needs before a
  create: ``{agent_ids, local_agent_id, default_password}`` read from the backup
  integration's in-process ``DATA_MANAGER``. ``local_agent_id`` uses the SAME
  preference the server's ``_get_local_backup_agent_id`` does (``hassio.local``
  over ``backup.local``). A missing backup integration / manager raises
  ``HomeAssistantError`` so the server's command-error fallback fires. The
  password is sensitive but the legacy ``backup/config/info`` already serves it
  to the same admin connection — parity, not new exposure.
* ``ha_mcp_tools/registries`` — the area / floor / label / category registries as
  the FULL-FIELD ``config/<x>_registry/list`` shapes (byte-compatible with the
  legacy WS list responses; timestamps as ``created_at`` / ``modified_at``
  floats via ``.timestamp()``). Only the requested ``registries`` keys are
  present; ``category`` REQUIRES a non-empty ``category_scopes`` (categories are
  scoped) — a ``category`` request without one raises ``HomeAssistantError``
  rather than silently serving ``{}``. ``category_registry`` is imported
  function-locally (not needed at module top).

``ha_mcp_tools/config_get`` was withdrawn before release: it served an entity's
``raw_config``, whose freshness lags the config file between a write and the next
completed reload (no version marker distinguishes a fresh body from a stale one),
so a get racing a reload returned a pre-edit body. ``ha_config_get_{automation,
script}`` stay on the legacy REST path (which reads the fresh config file);
scenes were already legacy-only. A file-reading redesign may return (issue #1813).

Design notes that are load-bearing:

* **Capability negotiation, not version-lockstep.** ``CAPABILITIES`` grows one
  entry per shipped command (except the always-present ``info`` handshake); the
  server asks "do you support ``search``?" rather than "are you >= X". The
  manifest version is reported for display only.
* **Data minimization.** Flow-helper indexing reads ``ConfigEntry.options`` /
  ``title`` only — **never** ``ConfigEntry.data`` (integration credentials).
* **YAML config bodies are never emitted.** automation/script/scene bodies are
  indexed for *matching*, but a matched item's ``config`` body is returned only
  when it is storage/editor-backed AND ``include_config`` is set. YAML-loaded
  items return identity/metadata only (their ``raw_config`` may carry resolved
  ``!secret`` plaintext). Body emission for YAML belongs to a future file-based
  tool.
* **Resolved secrets are scrubbed from the match corpus.** Because YAML bodies
  (and flow-helper options) can hold ``!secret`` values resolved to plaintext,
  a body leaf that exactly equals a ``secrets.yaml`` value is dropped before
  scoring (:func:`_load_secret_values`) — otherwise a query equal to a suspected
  secret would confirm it via ``match_in_config`` (a probe oracle). Blocked, not
  merely unemitted.
* **Event-loop hygiene.** Every registry/state join is a pure in-memory read
  over live data — run synchronously, no persistent index (always fresh, zero
  cache-invalidation surface). The one blocking read — ``secrets.yaml`` for the
  match-corpus scrub — runs in the executor via the command wrapper's async
  pre-step (:func:`_search_prep`), never on the event loop.

Extension point — to add another command later: write ``_do_<name>(hass,
params)``, append its capability to :data:`CAPABILITIES`, and add one row to
:func:`_command_specs`. ``info`` enumerates the rest.

    probe oracle — a query equal to a suspected secret confirmed via
    ``match_in_config``) and the ``options`` emitted by ``config_entries`` /

    ``degraded`` is True ONLY when a ``secrets.yaml`` is PRESENT but could not be

    surface ``degraded`` so an unredacted response is not mistaken for a cleanly

    ``entry_id`` key (``None``) selects list mode; an empty-string ``entry_id`` is
    a single-entry lookup for a nonexistent id, so it returns ``entries: []``
    (mirroring ``async_get_entry("")``) rather than falling through to list mode
    and returning the first entry. ``state`` is serialized as

    Data minimization: ``entry.data`` (integration credentials) is NEVER read.
    ``options`` is the only credential-bearing surface emitted, so it is passed

    (``subentry_id`` / ``subentry_type`` / ``title`` / ``unique_id``) — never a
    subentry's ``data``; a core version without subentries degrades to ``[]``.

    The scrub is BEST-EFFORT: a present-but-unreadable ``secrets.yaml`` degrades it
    to a no-op (options emitted unredacted). That degradation is signalled to the
    caller as ``secret_scrub_degraded: true`` (present ONLY when degraded), so an

       raises ``HomeAssistantError`` so the server's command-error path falls back to
       its legacy options-flow submit.
    2. Require at least one of ``channel`` / ``pip_spec`` (the server always sends
       one — this is defence-in-depth).
    3. Snapshot the ``delta`` (the provided fields, keyed by the OPT_* option keys)
       and the CURRENT ``entry.options`` — used ONLY for the no-op check and the
       ``previous``/``applying`` response envelope. Every UNtouched key is preserved
       because the actual write MERGES the delta against the LIVE ``entry.options``
       at APPLY time (step 5), NOT against this snapshot — so a concurrent change to
       another key during the flush window is not clobbered, and none of the
       URL/secret overrides get blanked (which is why the server drops its
       preserved-key resend on this path).
    4. No-op short-circuit: if the delta applied to the snapshot equals the current
       options, return ``{scheduled: False, unchanged: True, ...}`` WITHOUT
       scheduling. (The update listener's own ``DATA_LAST_OPTIONS`` guard would also
       make such an update not reload, but skipping the schedule keeps it explicit.)
    5. Otherwise schedule the deferred ``_apply`` — which re-reads the LIVE
       ``entry.options`` and merges the delta against THAT before calling
       ``async_update_entry`` — on a HASS-owned background task after
       :data:`SERVER_ENTRY_UPDATE_FLUSH_DELAY_S`, and return
       ``{scheduled: True, ...}`` immediately.

    **The deferred-reload crux.** ``async_update_entry`` fires the server entry's
    update listener, which reloads the entry — tearing down the very in-process
    server thread answering THIS frame. Calling it inline would kill that thread
    before the WS ``{scheduled: True}`` response flushed, so the caller would never
    get its confirmation. It is therefore scheduled after a flush delay. The task is
    created with :func:`hass.async_create_background_task` (hass-owned), NOT
    ``entry.async_create_background_task``: an entry-owned task is cancelled by the
    unload the reload performs, so it could cancel itself before firing — the exact
    trap ``embedded_entry._on_version_update`` documents. Being hass-owned, the task
    survives to invoke ``async_update_entry`` (a synchronous ``@callback`` that
    returns as soon as it schedules the listener), then completes; the reload it
    triggers runs as its own hass task after the response has flushed.

       fires the call, independent of (and in addition to) the server-side guard:
       a component ``call_service`` that skipped it would let a caller invoke the
       admin-gated ``ha_mcp_tools.get_caller_token`` in-process (the server IS
       admin) and then every file/YAML service. The block keys off the RESOLVED
       domain, so it holds no matter which path reaches this function.
    2. **ServiceNotFound** before dispatch, so an unknown service is a clean
       ``SERVICE_NOT_FOUND`` and never a landed-but-unreported write.
    3. Pre-state capture for each ``entity_id`` (a synchronous in-memory read).
    4. Register the expected-aware ``EVENT_STATE_CHANGED`` waiter BEFORE the dispatch
       (D5) so a fast entity's event can't arrive before the listener exists. The
       waiter confirms only on reaching the server's ``expected_state`` hint (skipping
       intermediate/noise events); a ``None`` hint keeps any-first-event confirmation.
    5. Fire exactly ONE ``async_call`` (``blocking=True``); flip ``dispatched``
       immediately after so a post-dispatch problem is never retried as a failed
       call (D3/D9).
    6. Immediate-match (:func:`_match_immediate`) for an idempotent no-op — a target
       whose CURRENT state already equals its hint confirms with NO wait — then a
       bounded wait for whatever is still unconfirmed (D4); expiry is ``partial``.
    7. Diff pre→post into the real transition(s) — the REAL observed transition, never
       the hint value.

    Raised exceptions PROPAGATE — the WS handler turns them into a command error the
    server maps (D7). Two distinct classes propagate: the D1 domain block and
    ``ServiceNotFound`` are PRE-dispatch (they raise before ``async_call``, so nothing
    landed); an ``async_call`` / ``return_response`` validation error is MID-dispatch
    (the handler may mutate state and THEN raise — the documented D9 at-most-once
    residual, NOT pre-dispatch). A confirmation timeout is caught and reported as
    ``partial`` (never re-raised): the call already landed.

    The whole POST-dispatch section — the immediate-match re-read, the wait, and the
    pre→post diff — runs inside ONE ``try`` that, once ``dispatched`` is True, never
    lets a raise escape (I1): a raise mapped to a command error would re-POST an
    already-landed write. A pre-confirmation ``async_call`` failure (``dispatched``
    still False) re-raises so the server can map it; any post-dispatch failure degrades
    to a minimal dispatched-but-unconfirmed envelope. The immediate-match re-read is
    itself raise-proof (:func:`_match_immediate`), the attribute diff is raise-proofed
    (:func:`_values_differ`), and ``unsub`` always runs in the ``finally``.
    Serialization residual (bounded, no sanitize pass): the transition embeds each
    state's ``as_dict()`` and the WS transport re-encodes it; HA core enforces
    JSON-serializable state attributes for its own REST/WS/recorder APIs, so a state
    that reached the component already serializes — re-encoding it here is safe.

       flag the moment its ``async_call`` returns.
