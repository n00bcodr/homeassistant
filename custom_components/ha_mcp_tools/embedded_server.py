"""Run the ha-mcp FastMCP server in-process inside Home Assistant (issue #1527).

The :class:`EmbeddedServerManager` owns the full lifecycle of the in-process
ha-mcp server:

* ensures the ``ha-mcp`` package is importable (runtime pip install via
  Home Assistant's requirements manager, honoring an options-flow pip-spec
  override for pre-release testing, and forcing a real reinstall when that spec
  changes),
* provisions a long-lived Home Assistant admin token the server uses to reach HA
  core over loopback (REST + WebSocket),
* runs the server on a dedicated thread with its own asyncio loop — uvicorn
  skips signal capture off the main thread and a heavy tool can never stall HA's
  event loop — and
* tears the thread down cleanly, and revokes the provisioned credentials when
  the entry is removed.

Everything the server needs from ha-mcp is imported **inside the worker thread**,
after the required non-secret environment variables are staged, so importing this
module never pulls in ``ha_mcp`` (which may not be installed yet) and never runs
before the connection is in place. The loopback URL and the admin token are handed
to ha-mcp **in memory** via ``ha_mcp.config.set_embedded_connection`` — never
through ``os.environ`` — so the admin token can never be read from the shared HA
process environment. ``ha_mcp`` module-level imports are therefore forbidden here.

        Without it, a reload after a pip install keeps serving the OLD code
        forever: all workers are threads of the one HA core process, and
        Python resolves ``import ha_mcp`` from sys.modules — installs only
        took effect after a full HA core restart (observed live: options
        saves reinstalled the package, the web UI footer showed the new
        on-disk version, yet the serving worker kept reporting the version
        it was first imported with).

        SKIPPED while any previous worker may still be importing — ripping
        entries out of sys.modules under a live importer corrupts its import
        in progress. Two guards cover that: the per-manager orphan (a worker
        this manager's stop could not join), and the process-global
        ``_IMPORTING_WORKERS`` registry, because every bring-up constructs a
        FRESH manager (async_bring_up_server) and an entry reload during a
        slow cold import otherwise hands the purge to a manager that has
        never heard of the still-importing worker — which then crashed
        mid-import with KeyError: 'ha_mcp.config' (issue #1904, live on
        1.1.1-dev.107). The post-start staleness check surfaces the
        consequence (old code possibly serving) instead.

        Also skipped when the cached modules already ARE the generation on
        disk: purging on every attempt made each retry pay the full cold
        import again, so slow hardware that missed the readiness window once
        could never recover (#1904). Never skipped under a pip-spec override
        — the one workflow where a reinstall can change the code without
        changing the version string (re-pointed tarball/pin), which a
        version-keyed skip would serve stale; channel installs mint a
        distinct version per build.

        Returns the installed version that the worker is about to run, for the
        caller's warm-cache purge decision.

        ``defer_mutations=True`` (a previous bring-up's worker is still
        importing) downgrades any would-be uninstall/force-install to the
        non-mutating fast path: replacing the distribution's files on disk
        under a live importer corrupts it the same way a sys.modules purge
        does. The deferred update applies on the next reload or HA restart.

        With auto-update on (the default) both channels install their
        distribution UNPINNED, so every entry reload / HA restart must pick up
        the newest build. Such a spec ALWAYS takes the force-install path
        (``upgrade=True``, bypassing the requirements manager's is-installed
        shortcut) — that is what makes the channel auto-update. This runs in a
        background task, so it never blocks HA startup, and uv no-ops quickly
        when the newest build is already installed.

        Fast path: reserved for a STABLE spec — an explicit pip-spec override (a
        version pin or tarball URL) or a channel with auto-update turned OFF
        (which pins to the installed version, see :meth:`_resolve_pip_spec`).
        When that spec matches the one last installed and the package imports,
        delegate the "already satisfied?" decision to Home Assistant's
        requirements manager; a pinned spec does not move, so there is nothing to
        upgrade to. A CHANGED spec (a new override, a cleared override, a
        toggled auto-update, a channel switch) falls through to the
        force-install path below — and additionally uninstalls the replaced
        distribution first (:meth:`_async_remove_replaced_source`), because
        ``upgrade=True`` alone decides by version and a changed SOURCE can keep
        the version string (issue #1914).

        On a channel switch the other channel's distribution is uninstalled first
        (:meth:`_async_remove_conflicting_dist`): ``ha-mcp`` and ``ha-mcp-dev``
        share the ``ha_mcp`` import package, so leaving both installed would make a
        pinned reinstall a no-op (breaking a dev→stable downgrade) and the reported
        version ambiguous.

        A one-shot pending-install marker (:data:`DATA_PENDING_INSTALL_VERSION`,
        set by the update entity's Install button — issue #1760) overrides both
        the unpinned-channel and auto-update-off pinning above for this single
        install, regardless of the ``auto_update`` option.

        ``project.version`` equals the release it branched from (only release
        automation bumps it), so its tarball installs with that same version
        string; clearing the override then resolves the channel spec to the
        exact version already on disk and the install swaps nothing, leaving
        the PR code running while the entry reports a clean channel install
        (issue #1914). The same version-blindness bites a manual spec edit
        that pins the version already installed. The installer cannot see the
        difference, so when the spec that produced the current install
        differs from the one about to be installed, the distribution the new
        spec resolves to by name (:meth:`_replaced_dist_name`) is removed
        first — the install that follows is then unconditionally real.

        Skipped when nothing is installed, when the last-installed spec is
        unknown (nothing to compare: first install, or entry data predating
        the spec tracking), when the spec is unchanged (the routine
        reload/restart path, where ``upgrade=True`` alone is correct and an
        uninstall would churn — and briefly break — a healthy install on
        every restart), when the new spec is a direct URL (always installs
        for real), when the named distribution is not installed (e.g. a
        cross-channel switch already removed it), when the stored spec is
        an index requirement on the SAME distribution (a repin — e.g.
        toggling auto-update rewrites bare ``ha-mcp`` to ``ha-mcp==X`` —
        draws from the same index either way, so version resolution is
        faithful and uninstalling a healthy install on a preference toggle
        would only add an offline-breakage window), or when the new spec is
        an exact pin on a version provably different from the installed one
        (the install cannot no-op, so the working build stays in place as
        the fallback if it fails).

        Unlike the other pre-install uninstalls this one is NOT best-effort:
        if the distribution survives a failed uninstall, the forced install
        would no-op as "already satisfied", the new spec would be persisted,
        and the next reload would see it as unchanged — reproducing #1914 and
        then permanently masking it. Raising instead keeps the stored spec on
        the old value, so the next reload retries the whole source change.
