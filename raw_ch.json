Hobbes: The turbo is pooped. Calvin: That\'s ok. Gravity just kicked in. Ever notice how decisions make chain reactions? Hobbes: How so? Calvin: Well, each decision we make determines the range of choices we\'ll face next. Take this fork in the road for instance.  Which way should we go? Arbitrarily, I choose left. Now, as a direct result of that decision, we\'re faced with another choice: should we jump this ledge or ride along the side of it? If we hadn\'t turned left at the fork, this new choice would never have come up.  Hobbes: I note, with some dismay, you\'ve chosen to jump the ledge. Calvin: Right. And that decision will give us new choices. Hobbes: Like, should we bail out or die in the landing? Calvin: Exactly.  Our first decision created a chain reaction of decisions. Let\'s jump. See? If you don\'t make each decision carefully, you never know where you\'ll end up.  That\'s an important lesson we should learn sometime. Hobbes: I wish we could talk about these things without the visual aids.', hasDescription: true, publishedDate: new Date(1990, 3, 15)},
